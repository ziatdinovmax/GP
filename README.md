# GP
Gaussian processes (GP) for microscopic measurements (so far running "synthetic experiments")

To perform GP-based reconstruction of sparse hyperspectral data run ```python3 reconstruct.py <path/to/file/filepath.npy>```

To perform GP-based sample exploration based on the reduction of maximal uncertainty run ```python3 explore.py <path/to/file/filepath.npy>```

More details TBA
